            <p class="card-text">
                Manton Dam is a great spot to escape the heat and relax by the water. Hugely popular for watersports, the Dam is often a hive of activity. Built in 1942, Manton Dam was Darwin’s first reliable water supply. Today, although its water is still used in emergencies, it is a popular, recreation area. Its relatively undisturbed drainage area is also a valuable catchment and conservation area.
